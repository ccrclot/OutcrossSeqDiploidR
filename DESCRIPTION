Title: Bin-marker Inference From Low Coverage Sequencing of
 Diploid Outcrossing Population
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Corentin Clot
Description: Following the idea of OutcrossSeq <doi:10.1016/j.molp.2021.01.003>,
 OutcrossSeqDiploidR contains the functions necessary to locally infer
 bin-markers using sequence variants called from low coverage sequencing data of a
 diploid outcrossing population.
 Parent specific sequence variants within bins of arbitrary length are used to calculate
 local distance between individuals. This distance information is then used
 to cluster individuals into local bin-markers alleles. This inferred bin-marker
 are further quality checked based on recombination freqeuncy and local deviation from
 local transmission ratio.
